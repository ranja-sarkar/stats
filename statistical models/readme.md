**Statistical models** can be widely divided into **discriminative** and **generative** models. Discriminative models leverage conditional probability distributions while generative ones leverage non-conditional (joint) distributions.

Example -

Discriminative classifiers assume a functional form of P(Y|X) and estimate the parameters from input data.
Generative classifiers assume a functional form for P(Y) and P(X|Y), then generate parameters from the data and use the Bayesâ€™ theorem to calculate the posterior probability.
